A Radio With Guts 


it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street 
I used to get drunk 

and throw the radio through the window 
while it was playing, and, of course, 
it would break the glass in the window 
and the radio would sit there on the roof 
still playing 

and I'd tell my woman, 

 “Ah, what a marvelous radio ! “ 
the next morning I'd take the window 
off the hinges 

and carry it down the street 

to the glass man 

who would put in another pane. 

I kept throwing that radio through the window 

each time I got drunk 

and it would sit there on the roof 

still playing- 

a magic radio 

a radio with guts, 

and each morning I'd take the window 
back to the glass man. 

I don't remember how it ended exactly 
though I do remember 
we finally moved out. 

there was a woman downstairs who worked in 

the garden in her bathing suit, 

she really dug with that trowel 

and she put her behind up in the air 

and I used to sit in the window 

and watch the sun shine all over that thing 

while the music played.

a smile to remember 


we had goldfish and they circled around and around 

in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes 

covering the picture window and 

my mother, always smiling, wanting us all 

to be happy, told me, "be happy Henry!" 

and she was right: it's better to be happy if you 

can 

but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while 
raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't 
understand what was attacking him from within. 

my mother, poor fish, 

wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a 
week, telling me to be happy: "Henry, smile! 
why don't you ever smile?" 

and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the 
saddest smile I ever saw 

one day the goldfish died, all five of them, 
they floated on the water, on their sides, their 
eyes still open, 

and when my father got home he threw them to the cat 
there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother 
smiled

Alone With Everybody 


the flesh covers the bone 
and they put a mind 
in there and 
sometimes a soul, 
and the women break 
vases against the walls 
and the men drink too 
much 

and nobody finds the 
one 

but keep 
looking 

crawling in and out 
of beds, 
flesh covers 
the bone and the 
flesh searches 
for more than 
flesh. 

there's no chance 
at all: 

we are all trapped 
by a singular 
fate. 

nobody ever finds 
the one. 

the city dumps fill 
the junkyards fill 
the madhouses fill 
the hospitals fill 
the graveyards fill 

nothing else 
fills.

An Almost Made Up Poem 


I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny 

blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny 

they are small, and the fountain is in France 

where you wrote me that last letter and 

I answered and never heard from you again. 

you used to write insane poems about 

ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you 

knew famous artists and most of them 

were your lovers, and I wrote back, it&#146; all right, 

go ahead, enter their lives, I&#146; not jealous 

because we&#146; never met. we got close once in 

New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never 

touched, so you went with the famous and wrote 

about the famous, and, of course, what you found out 

is that the famous are worried about 

their fame &#150;&#150; not the beautiful young girl in bed 

with them, who gives them that, and then awakens 

in the morning to write upper case poems about 

ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they&#146; told 

us, but listening to you I wasn&#146; sure, maybe 

it was the upper case, you were one of the 

best female poets and I told the publishers, 

editors, &#147; her, print her, she&#146; mad but she&#146; 

magic. there&#146; no lie in her fire. &# 148; I loved you 

like a man loves a woman he never touches, only 

writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have 

loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a 

cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom, 

but that didn&#146; happen, your letters got sadder. 

your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all 

lovers betray, it didn&#146; help, you said 

you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and 

the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying 

bench every night and wept for the lovers who had 

hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never 

heard again, a friend wrote me of your suicide 

3 or 4 months after it happened, if I had met you 

I would probably have been unfair to you or you 

to me. it was best like this.

And The Moon And The Stars And The World

Another Day 


having the low down blues and going 

into a restraunt to eat. 

you sit at a table. 

the waitress smiles at you. 

she's dumpy, her ass is too big. 

she radiates kindess and symphaty. 

live with her 3 months and a man would no real agony. 

o.k., you'll tip her 15 percent. 

you order a turkey sandwich and a 

beer. 

the man at the table across from you 

has watery blue eyes and 

a head like an elephant. 

at a table further down are 3 men 

with very tiny heads 

and long necks 

like ostiches. 

they talk loudly of land development, 
why, you think, did I ever come 
in here when I have the low-down 
blues? 

then the the waitress comes back eith the sandwich 

and she asks you if there will be anything 

else? 

snd you tell her, no no, this will be 
fine. 

then somebody behind you laughs, 
it's a cork laugh filled with sand and 
broken glass. 

you begin eating the sandwhich. 

it's something, 
it's a minor, difficult, 
sensible action 

like composing a popular song 
to make a 14-year old 
weep. 

you order another beer. 
jesus,look at that guy 

his hands hang down almost to his knees and he's 
whistling. 

well, time to get out. 
pivk up the bill, 
tip. 

go to the register, 
pay. 

pick up a toothpick. 

go out the door. 

your car is still there. 

and there are 3 men with heads 

and necks 


  


13 



like ostriches all getting into one 
car. 

they each have a toothpick and now 
they are talking about women, 
they drive away first 
they drive away fast, 
they're best i guess, 
it's an unberably hot day. 
there's a first-stage smog alert, 
all the birds and plants are dead 
or dying. 

you start the engine.

Are You Drinking? 


washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook 
out again 

I write from the bed 
as I did last 
year. 

will see the doctor, 

Monday. 

 “yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head- 
aches and my back 
hurts.  “ 

 “are you drinking? “ he will ask. 
 “are you getting your 
exercise, your 
vitamins? “ 

I think that I am just ill 
with life, the same stale yet 
fluctuating 
factors. 

even at the track 
I watch the horses run by 
and it seems 
meaningless. 

I leave early after buying tickets on the 
remaining races. 

 “taking off? “ asks the motel 
clerk. 

 “yes, it's boring,  “ 

I tell him. 

 “If you think it's boring 

out there,  “ he tells me,  “you oughta be 

back here. “ 

so here I am 

propped up against my pillows 
again 

just an old guy 

just an old writer 

with a yellow 

notebook. 

something is 

walking across the 

floor 

toward 

me. 

oh, it's just 
my cat 
this 
time.

As The Sparrow 


To give life you must take life, 
and as our grief falls flat and hollow 
upon the billion-blooded sea 

I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed 
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures 
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes. 
Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow 
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be 
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh. 

I hated you when it would have taken less courage 
to love. 

Charles Bukowski

back to the machine gun 

I awaken about noon and go out to get the mail 
in my old torn bathrobe. 

I'm hung over 

hair down in my eyes 

barefoot 

gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks 
in my path 

still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard. 

the young housewife next door shakes a rug 
out of her window and sees me: 

"hello, Hank!" 

god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass 
with a .22 

"hello," I say 

gathering up my Visa card bill, my Pennysaver coupons, 

a Dept, of Water and Power past-due notice, 

a letter from the mortgage people 

plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department 

giving me 30 days to clean up my act. 

I mince back again over the small sharp rocks 
thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight, 
they all seem 
to be closing in. 

there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers, 
the night harness races will have to wait.

Big Night On The Town 

drunk on the dark streets of some city, 
it's night, you're lost, where's your 
room? 

you enter a bar to find yourself, 
order scotch and water, 
damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks 
part of one of your shirt 
sleeves. 

It's a clip joint-the scotch is weak, 
you order a bottle of beer. 

Madame Death walks up to you 

wearing a dress. 

she sits down, you buy her a 

beer, she stinks of swamps, presses 

a leg against you. 

the bar tender sneers. 

you've got him worried, he doesn't 

know if you're a cop, a killer, a 

madman or an 

Idiot. 

you ask for a vodka. 

you pour the vodka into the top of 

the beer bottle. 

It's one a.m. In a dead cow world, 
you ask her how much for head, 
drink everything down, it tastes 
like machine oil. 

you leave Madame Death there, 
you leave the sneering bartender 
there. 

you have remembered where 
your room is. 

the room with the full bottle of 
wine on the dresser, 
the room with the dance of the 
roaches. 

Perfection in the Star Turd 
where love died 
laughing.

she died of alcoholism 
wrapped in a blanket 
on a deck chair 
on an ocean 
steamer. 

all her books of 
terrified loneliness 

all her books about 
the cruelty 
of loveless love 

were all that was left 
of her 

as the strolling vacationer 
discovered her body 

notified the captain 

and she was quickly dispatched 
to somewhere else 
on the ship 

as everything 
continued just 
as 

she had written it

close to greatness 

at one stage in my life 
I met a man who claimed to have 
visited Pound at St. Elizabeths. 

then I met a woman who not only 
claimed to have visited 

E.P. 

but also to have made love 
to him— she even showed 
me 

certain sections in the 
Cantos 

where Ezra was supposed to have 

mentioned 

her. 

so there was this man and 
this woman 

and the woman told me 
that Pound had never 
mentioned a visit from this 
man 

and the man claimed that the 
lady had had nothing to do 
with the 
master 

that she was a 
charlatan 

and since I wasn't a 
Poundian scholar 
I didn't know who to 
believe 

but one thing I do 
know: when a man is 
living 

many claim relationships 
that are hardly 
so 

and after he dies, well, 
then it's everybody's 
party. 

my guess is that Pound 
knew neither the lady or the 
gentleman 

or if he knew 
one 

or if he knew 
both

Confession 


waiting for death 
like a cat 

that will jump on the 
bed 

I am so very sorry for 
my wife 

she will see this 

stiff 

white 

body 

shake it once, then 

maybe 

again 

"Hank!" 

Hank won't 
answer. 

it's not my death that 
worries me, it's my wife 
left with this 
pile of 
nothing. 

I want to 
let her know 
though 

that all the nights 
sleeping 
beside her 

even the useless 
arguments 
were things 
ever splendid 

and the hard 
words 

I ever feared to 
say 

can now be 
said: 

I love 
you.

Consummation Of Grief 


I even hear the mountains 

the way they laugh 

up and down their blue sides 

and down in the water 

the fish cry 

and the water 

is their tears. 

I listen to the water 

on nights I drink away 

and the sadness becomes so great 

I hear it in my clock 

it becomes knobs upon my dresser 

it becomes paper on the floor 

it becomes a shoehorn 

a laundry ticket 

it becomes 

cigarette smoke 

climbing a chapel of dark vines. . . 

it matters little 

very little love is not so bad 

or very little life 

what counts 

is waiting on walls 

I was born for this 

I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.

Curtain 


the final curtain on one of the longest running 
musicals ever, some people claim to have 
seen it over one hundred times. 

I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain: 
flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous 
accolade. 

I have not seen this particular musical 
but I know if I had that I wouldn't have 
been able to bear it, it would have 
sickened me. 

trust me on this, the world and its 
peoples and its artful entertainment has 
done very little for me, only to me. 
still, let them enjoy one another, it will 
keep them from my door 
and for this, my own thunderous 
accolade.

Cut While Shaving 


It's never quite right, he said, the way people look, 
the way the music sounds, the way the words are 
written. 

It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are 

taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we 

die, all the lives we live, 

they are never quite right, 

they are hardly close to right, 

these lives we live 

one after the other, 

piled there as history, 

the waste of the species, 

the crushing of the light and the way, 

it's not quite right, 

it's hardly right at all 

he said. 

don't I know it? I 
answered. 

I walked away from the mirror. 

it was morning, it was afternoon, it was 

night 

nothing changed 
it was locked in place. 

something flashed, something broke, something 
remained. 

I walked down the stairway and 
into it.

Death Wants More Death 


death wants more death, and its webs are full: 

I remember my father's garage, how child-like 

I would brush the corpses of flies 

from the windows they thought were escape- 

their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies 

shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass 

only to spin and flit 

in that second larger than hell or heaven 
onto the edge of the ledge, 
and then the spider from his dank hole 
nervous and exposed 
the puff of body swelling 
hanging there 
not really quite knowing, 
and then knowing- 
something sending it down its string, 
the wet web, 

toward the weak shield of buzzing, 
the pulsing; 

a last desperate moving hair-leg 

there against the glass 

there alive in the sun, 

spun in white; 

and almost like love: 

the closing over, 

the first hushed spider-sucking: 

filling its sack 

upon this thing that lived; 

crouching there upon its back 

drawing its certain blood 

as the world goes by outside 

and my temples scream 

and I hurl the broom against them: 

the spider dull with spider-anger 

still thinking of its prey 

and waving an amazed broken leg; 

the fly very still, 

a dirty speck stranded to straw; 

I shake the killer loose 

and he walks lame and peeved 

towards some dark corner 

but I intercept his dawdling 

his crawling like some broken hero, 

and the straws smash his legs 

now waving 

above his head 

and looking 

looking for the enemy 

and somewhat valiant, 

dying without apparent pain 

simply crawling backward 

piece by piece 


  


31 



leaving nothing there 

until at last the red gut sack 

splashes 

its secrets, 

and I run child-like 

with God's anger a step behind, 

back to simple sunlight, 

wondering 

as the world goes by 
with curled smile 
if anyone else 
saw or sensed my crime

Decline 


naked along the side of the house, 

8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil 
over my body, Jesus, have I come 
to this? 

I once battled in dark alleys for a 
laugh. 

now I'm not laughing. 

I splash myself with oil and wonder, 

how many years do you want? 

how many days? 

my blood is soiled and a dark 

angel sits in my brain. 

things are made of something and 

go to nothing. 

I understand the fall of cities, of 
nations. 

a small plane passes overhead. 

I look upward as if it made sense to 
look upward. 

it's true, the sky has rotted: 
it won't be long for any of 
us.

Eat Your Heart Out 


I've come by, she says, to tell you 
that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's 
over, this is it. 

I sit on the couch watching her arrange 
her long red hair before my bedroom 
mirror. 

she pulls her hair up and 
piles it on top of her head- 
she lets her eyes look at 
my eyes- 

then she drops her hair and 

lets it fall down in front of her face. 

we go to bed and I hold her 

speechlessly from the back 

my arm around her neck 

I touch her wrists and hands 

feel up to 

her elbows 

no further. 

she gets up. 

this is it, she says, 

this will do. well, 

I'm going. 

I get up and walk her 
to the door 
just as she leaves 
she says, 

I want you to buy me 
some high-heeled shoes 
with tall thin spikes, 
black high-heeled shoes, 
no, I want them 
red. 

I watch her walk down the cement walk 

under the trees 

she walks all right and 

as the pointsettas drip in the sun 

I close the door.

Eulogy To A Hell Of A Dame 


some dogs who sleep At night 
must dream of bones 
and I remember your bones 
in flesh 
and best 

in that dark green dress 
and those high-heeled bright 
black shoes, 

you always cursed when you drank, 

your hair coming down you 

wanted to explode out of 

what was holding you: 

rotten memories of a 

rotten 

past, and 

you finally got 

out 

by dying, 

leaving me with the 

rotten 

present; 

you've been dead 
28 years 

yet I remember you 
better than any of 
the rest; 

you were the only one 
who understood 
the futility of the 
arrangement of 
life; 

all the others were only 
displeased with 
trivial segments, 
carped 

nonsensically about 
nonsense; 

Jane, you were 
killed by 

knowing too much. 

here's a drink 

to your bones 

that 

this dog 

still 

dreams about.

death as you can 
get.

dark

totally, 
it's not

up and 
down 
sidewalks 
past buildings 
around the 
corner

For Jane 


225 days under grass 
and you know more than I. 
they have long taken your blood, 
you are a dry stick in a basket, 
is this how it works? 
in this room 
the hours of love 
still make shadows. 

when you left 
you took almost 
everything. 

I kneel in the nights 

before tigers 

that will not let me be. 

what you were 
will not happen again, 
the tigers have found me 
and I do not care. 

Charles Bukowski

For Jane: With All The Love I Had, Which Was Not Enough 

I pick up the skirt, 

I pick up the sparkling beads 
in black, 

this thing that moved once 

around flesh, 

and I call God a liar, 

I say anything that moved 
like that 
or knew 
my name 
could never die 

in the common verity of dying, 
and I pick 
up her lovely 
dress, 

all her loveliness gone, 
and I speak to all the gods, 

Jewish gods, Christ-gods, 

chips of blinking things, 

idols, pills, bread, 

fathoms, risks, 

knowledgeable surrender, 

rats in the gravy of 2 gone quite mad 

without a chance, 

hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance, 

I lean upon this, 

I lean on all of this 
and I know: 

her dress upon my arm: 
but 

they will not 
give her back to me.

Freedom 


he drank wine all night of the 
28th, and he kept thinking of her: 
the way she walked and talked and loved 
the way she told him things that seemed true 
but were not, and he knew the color of each 
of her dresses 

and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of 
each heel 

as well as the leg shaped by it. 

and she was out again and when he came home, and 
she'd come back with that special stink again, 
and she did 

she came in at 3 a.m in the morning 
filthy like a dung eating swine 
and 

he took out a butchers knife 
and she screamed 

backing into the rooming house wall 

still pretty somehow 

in spite of love's reek 

and he finished the glass of wine. 

that yellow dress 
his favorite 

and she screamed again. 

and he took up the knife 

and unhooked his belt 

and tore away the cloth before her 

and cut off his balls. 

and carried them in his hands 
like apricots 

and flushed them down the 
toilet bowl 

and she kept screaming 
as the room became red 

GOD 0 GOD! 

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? 

and he sat there holding 3 towels 
between his legs 

no caring now whether she left or 
stayed 

wore yellow or green or 
anything at all. 

and one hand holding and one hand 
lifting he poured 
another wine

Friends Within The Darkness 


I can remember starving in a 
small room in a strange city 
shades pulled down, listening to 
classical music 

I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife 
inside 

because there was no alternative except to hide as long 
as possible-- 

not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance: 
trying to connect. 

the old composers — Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, 

Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and 
they were dead. 

finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into 
the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and 
monotonous 
jobs 

by strange men behind desks 
men without eyes men without faces 
who would take away my hours 
break them 
piss on them. 

now I work for the editors the readers the 
critics 

but still hang around and drink with 
Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the 
Bee 

some buddies 
some men 

sometimes all we need to be able to continue alone 
are the dead 
rattling the walls 
that close us in.

gamblers all 


sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, 

<i>I'm not going to make it</i>, but you laugh inside 

remembering all the times you've felt that way, and 

you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face 

in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway, 

get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the 

newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your 

wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself, 

like millions of others you enter the arena once more. 

you are on the freeway threading through traffic now, 

moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch 

the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow 

get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull 

days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful 

and so disappointing because 

we are all so alike and so different. 

you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous 
part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works 
his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and 
out through your shoes. 

it's been a tough fight worth fighting 
as we all drive along 
betting on another day.

Girl In A Miniskirt Reading The Bible Outside My Window 

Sunday, I am eating a 

grapefruit, church is over at the Russian 

Orthadox to the 

west. 

she is dark 
of Eastern descent, 

large brown eyes look up from the Bible 
then down, a small red and black 
Bible, and as she reads 
her legs keep moving, moving, 
she is doing a slow rythmic dance 
reading the Bible. . . 

long gold earrings; 

2 gold bracelets on each arm, 
and it's a mini-suit, I suppose, 
the cloth hugs her body, 
the lightest of tans is that cloth, 
she twists this way and that, 
long yellow legs warm in the sun. . . 

there is no escaping her being 
there is no desire to. . . 

my radio is playing symphonic music 

that she cannot hear 

but her movements coincide exactly 

to the rythms of the 

symphony. . . 

she is dark, she is dark 
she is reading about God. 

I am God.

having the flu and with nothing else to do 

I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to 
the book once radical-communist 

John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments 

and reading the 

<i > Wall Street Journal </i> 

this seems to happen all too often. 

what hardly ever happens is 

a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an 
old wild-ass radical 

however: 

young conservatives always seem to become old 
conservatives. 

it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock. 

but when a young radical ends up an 
old radical 
the critics 

and the conservatives 

treat him as if he escaped from a mental 

institution. 

such is our politics and you can have it 
all. 

keep it. 

sail it up your 
ass.

hello, how are you? 


this fear of being what they are: 
dead. 

at least they are not out on the street, they 
are careful to stay indoors, those 
pasty mad who sit alone before their tv sets, 
their lives full of canned, mutilated laughter. 

their ideal neighborhood 
of parked cars 
of ittle green lawns 
of ittle homes 

the little doors that open and close 
as their relatives visit 
throughout the holidays 
the doors closing 

behind the dying who die so slowly 
behind the dead who are still alive 
in your quiet average neighborhood 
of winding streets 
of agony 
of confusion 
of horror 
of fear 
of ignorance. 

a dog standing behind a fence, 
a man silent at the window.

Here I Am ... 


drunk again at 3 a.m. at the end of my 2nd bottle 
of wine, I have typed from a dozen to 15 pages of 
poesy 
an old man 

maddened for the flesh of young girls in this 

dwindling twilight 

liver gone 

kidneys going 

pancrea pooped 

top-floor blood pressure

His Wife, The Painter 

There are sketches on the walls of men and women and ducks, 
and outside a large green bus swerves through traffic like 
insanity sprung from a waving line; Turgenev, Turgenev, 
says the radio, and Jane Austin, Jane Austin, too. 

 “I am going to do her portrait on the 28th, while you are 
at work. “

Hooray Say The Roses 


hooray say the roses, today is blamesday 
and we are red as blood. 

hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday 

and we bloom wher soldiers fell 

and lovers too, 

and the snake at the word. 

hooray say the roses, darkness comes 
all at once, like lights gone out, 
the sun leaves dark continents 
and rows of stone. 

hooray say the roses, cannons and spires, 

birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday 

the hand holding a medal out the window, 

a moth going by, half a mile an hour, 

hooray hooray 

hooray say the roses 

we have empires on our stems, 

the sun moves the mouth: 

hooray hooray hooray 

and that is why you like us.

Hot 


she was hot, she was so hot 
I didn't want anybody else to have her, 
and if I didn't get home on time 
she'd be gone, and I couldn't bearthat- 
I'd go mad. . . 

it was foolish I know, childish, 
but I was caught in it, I was caught. 

1 delivered all the mail 

and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run 
in an old army truck, 

the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run 

and the night went on 

me thinking about my hot Miriam 

and jumping in and out of the truck 

filling mailsacks 

the engine continuing to heat up 

the temperature needle was at the top 

HOT HOT 

like Miriam. 

leaped in and out 

3 more pickups and into the station 
I'd be, my car 

waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch 

with scotch on the rocks 

crossing her legs and swinging her ankles 

like she did, 

2 more stops. . . 

the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell 
kicking it over 
again. . . 

I had to be home by 8,8 was the deadline for Miriam. 

I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal 
1/2 block from the station. . . 
it wouldn't start, it couldn't start. . . 

I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the 
station. . . 

I threw the keys down. . .signed out. . . 
your goddamned truck is stalled at the signal, 

I shouted, 

Pico and Western. . . 

. . .1 ran down the hall, put the key into the door, 
opened it. . .her drinking glass was there, and a note:

How Is Your Heart? 


during my worst times 
on the park benches 
in the jails 
or living with 
whores 

I always had this certain 
contentment- 
I wouldn't call it 
happiness- 

it was more of an inner 
balance 

that settled for 
whatever was occuring 
and it helped in the 
factories 

and when relationships 
went wrong 
with the 
girls.

I like your books 


In the betting line the other 
day 

man behind me asked, 

"are you Henry 
Chinaski?" 

"uh huh," I answered. 

"I like your books," he went 
on. 

"thanks," I answered. 

"who do you like in this 
race?" he asked. 

"uh uh," I answered. 

"I like the 4 horse," he 
told me. 

I made my bet and went back 
to my seat.... 

the next race I am standing in 
line and here is this same man 
standing behind me 
again. 

there are at least 50 lines at 
the windows but 
he has to find mine 
again. 

"I think this race favors the 
closers," he said to the back of 
my neck, "the track looks 
heavy." 

"listen," I said, not looking 
around, "it's the kiss of death to 
talk about horses at the 
track..." 

"what kind of rule is that?" 
he asked. "God doesn't make 
rules..." 

I turned around and looked at him: 

"maybe not, but I 

do." 

after the next race

I got in line, glanced behind 
me: 

he was not there: 

lost another reader. 

I lose 2 or 3 each 
week.

I Met A Genius 


I met a genius on the train 
today 

about 6 years old, 

he sat beside me 

and as the train 

ran down along the coast 

we came to the ocean 

and then he looked at me 

and said, 

it's not pretty.

I'm In Love 


she's young, she said, 
but look at me, 

I have pretty ankles, 

and look at my wrists, I have pretty 

wrists 

0 my god, 

1 thought it was all working, 
and now it's her again, 

every time she phones you go crazy, 

you told me it was over 

you told me it was finished, 

listen, I've lived long enough to become a 

good woman, 

why do you need a bad woman? 

you need to be tortured, don't you? 

you think life is rotten if somebody treats you 

rotten it all fits, 

doesn't it? 

tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a 
piece of shit? 

and my son, my son was going to meet you. 

I told my son 

and I dropped all my lovers. 

I stood up in a cafe and screamed 
I'M IN LOVE, 

and now you've made a fool of me. . . 

I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry. 

hold me, she said, will you please hold me? 

I've never been in one of these things before, I said, 
these triangles. . . 

she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all 
over.she paced up and down, wild and crazy. she had 
a small body. her arms were thin, very thin and when 
she screamed and started beating me I held her 
wrists and then I got it through the eyes: hatred, 
centuries deep and true. I was wrong and graceless and 
sick. all the things I had learned had been wasted, 
there was no creature living as foul as I 
and all my poems were 
false.

It's Ours 


there is always that space there 

just before they get to us 

that space 

that fine relaxer 

the breather 

while say 

flopping on a bed 

thinking of nothing 

or say 

pouring a glass of water from the 
spigot 

while entranced by 
nothing 

that 

gentle pure 
space 

it's worth 

centuries of 
existence 

say 

just to scratch your neck 
while looking out the window at 
a bare branch 

that space 
there 

before they get to us 

ensures 

that 

when they do 
they won't 
get it all 

ever.

Layover 


Making love in the sun, in the morning sun 
in a hotel room 
above the alley 

where poor men poke for bottles; 
making love in the sun 

making love by a carpet redder than our blood, 
making love while the boys sell headlines 
and Cadillacs, 

making love by a photograph of Paris 
and an open pack of Chesterfields, 
making love while other men- poor folks- 
work. 

That moment- to this. . . 

may be years in the way they measure, 

but it's only one sentence back in my mind- 

there are so many days 

when living stops and pulls up and sits 

and waits like a train on the rails. 

I pass the hotel at 8 

and at 5; there are cats in the alleys 

and bottles and bums, 

and I look up at the window and think, 

I no longer know where you are, 
and I walk on and wonder where 
the living goes 
when it stops.

Let It Enfold You 


either peace or happiness, 
let it enfold you 

when I was a young man 
I felt these things were 
dumb, unsophisticated. 

I had bad blood, a twisted 
mind, a precarious 
upbringing. 

I was hard as granite, I 

leered at the 

sun. 

I trusted no man and 
especially no 
woman. 

I was living a hell in 
small rooms, I broke 
things, smashed things, 
walked through glass, 
cursed. 

I challenged everything, 
was continually being 
evicted, jailed, in and 
out of fights, in and out 
of my mind. 

women were something 
to screw and rail 
at, I had no male 
freinds, 

I changed jobs and 
cities, I hated holidays, 
babies, history, 
newspapers, museums, 
grandmothers, 
marriage, movies, 
spiders, garbagemen, 
english accents, Spain, 
france,italy, walnuts and 
the color 
orange. 

algebra angred me, 
opera sickened me, 

Charlie chaplin was a 
fake 

and flowers were for 
pansies. 

peace an happiness to me 
were signs of 


  


64 



inferiority, 

tenants of the weak 

an 

addled 

mind. 

but as I went on with 
my alley fights, 
my suicidal years, 
my passage through 
any number of 
women-it gradually 
began to occur to 
me 

that I wasn't different 
from the 

others, I was the same, 

they were all fulsome 

with hatred, 

glossed over with petty 

greivances, 

the men I fought in 

alleys had hearts of stone. 

everybody was nudging, 

inching, cheating for 

some insignificant 

advantage, 

the lie was the 

weapon and the 

plot was 

empty, 

darkness was the 
dictator. 

cautiously, I allowed 
myself to feel good 
at times. 

I found moments of 
peace in cheap 
rooms 

just staring at the 
knobs of some 
dresser 

or listening to the 
rain in the 
dark. 

the less I needed 
the better I 
felt. 


  


65 



maybe the other life had worn me 
down. 

I no longer found 
glamour 

in topping somebody 
in conversation, 
or in mounting the 
body of some poor 
drunken female 
whose life had 
slipped away into 
sorrow. 

I could never accept 
life as it was, 
i could never gobble 
down all its 
Doisons 

3ut there were parts, 
tenous magic parts 
open for the 
asking. 

I re formulated 
I don't know when, 
date, time, all 
that 

but the change 
occured. 

something in me 
relaxed, smoothed 
out. 

i no longer had to 
prove that I was a 
man, 

I did'nt have to prove 
anything. 

I began to see things: 
coffee cups lined up 
behind a counter in a 
cafe. 

or a dog walking along 
a sidewalk. 

or the way the mouse 
on my dresser top 
stopped there 
with its body, 
its ears, 
its nose, 
it was fixed, 


  


66 



a bit of life 
caught within itself 
and its eyes looked 
at me 

and they were 
beautiful, 
then- it was 
gone. 

I began to feel good, 

I began to feel good 
in the worst situations 
and there were plenty 
of those. 

like say, the boss 
behind his desk, 
he is going to have 
to fire me. 

I've missed too many 
days. 

he is dressed in a 
suit, necktie, glasses, 
he says, "I am going 
to have to let you go" 

"it's all right" I tell 
him. 

He must do what he 
must do, he has a 
wife, a house, children, 
expenses, most probably 
a girlfreind. 

I am sorry for him 
he is caught. 

I walk onto the blazing 

sunshine. 

the whole day is 

mine 

temporailiy, 

anyhow. 

(the whole world is at the 
throat of the world, 
everybody feels angry, 
short-changed, cheated, 
everybody is despondent, 
dissillusioned) 


  


67 



I welcomed shots of 
peace, tattered shards of 
happiness. 

I embraced that stuff 
like the hottest number, 
like high heels, breasts, 
singing, the 
works. 

(dont get me wrong, 

there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism 

that overlooks all 

basic problems just for 

the sake of 

itself- 

this is a shield and a 
sickness.) 

The knife got near my 
throat again, 

I almost turned on the 

gas 

again 

but when the good 
moments arrived 
again 

I did'nt fight them off 
like an alley 
adversary. 

I let them take me, 
i luxuriated in them, 

I bade them welcome 
home. 

I even looked into 
the mirror 

once having thought 
myself to be 
ugly, 

I now liked what 
I saw, almost 
handsome, yes, 
a bit ripped and 
ragged, 
scares, lumps, 
odd turns, 
but all in all, 
not too bad, 
almost handsome, 
better at least than 
some of those movie 
star faces 


  


68 



like the cheeks of 

a baby's 

butt. 

and finally I discovered 

real feelings of 

others, 

unheralded, 

like lately, 

like this morning, 

as I was leaving, 

for the track, 

i saw my wife in bed, 

just the 

shape of 

her head there 

(not forgetting 

centuries of the living 

and the dead and 

the dying, 

the pyramids, 

Mozart dead 

but his music still 

there in the 

room, weeds growing, 

the earth turning, 

the toteboard waiting for 

me) 

I saw the shape of my 
wife's head, 
she so still, 

I ached for her life, 
just being there 
under the 
covers. 

I kissed her in the, 
forehead, 

got down the stairway, 

got outside, 

got into my marvelous 

car, 

fixed the seatbelt, 
backed out the 
drive. 

feeling warm to 
the fingertips, 
down to my 
foot on the gas 
pedal, 

I entered the world 
once 


  


69 



more, 

drove down the 
hill 

past the houses 
full and empty 
of 

people, 

I saw the mailman, 

honked, 

he waved 

back 

at me.

Like A Flower In The Rain 


I cut the middle fingernail of the middle 

finger 

right hand 

real short 

and I began rubbing along her cunt 
as she sat upright in bed 
spreading lotion over her arms 
face 

and breasts 

after bathing. 

then she lit a cigarette: 

 “don't let this put you off, “ 
an smoked and continued to rub 
the lotion on. 

I continued to rub the cunt. 

 “You want an apple? “ I asked. 

 “sure, she said,  “you got one? “ 

but I got to her- 

she began to twist 

then she rolled on her side, 

she was getting wet and open 

like a flower in the rain. 

then she rolled on her stomach 

and her most beautiful ass 

looked up at me 

and I reached under and got the 
cunt again. 

she reached around and got my 
cock, she rolled and twisted, 

I mounted 

my face falling into the mass 
of red hair that overflowed 
from her head 

and my flattened cock entered 

into the miracle. 

later we joked about the lotion 

and the cigarette and the apple. 

then I went out and got some chicken 

and shrimp and french fries and buns 

and mashed potatoes and gravy and 

cole slaw, and we ate. she told me 

how good she felt and I told her 

how good I felt and we 

ate the chicken and the shrimp and the

Love & Fame & Death 


it sits outside my window now 

like and old woman going to market; 

it sits and watches me, 

it sweats nervously 

through wire and fog and dog-bark 

until suddenly 

I slam the screen with a newspaper 

like slapping at a fly 

and you could hear the scream 

over this plain city,

and then it left. 

the way to end a poem 
like this 

is to become suddenly 
quiet.

magical mystery tour 

I am in this low-slung sports car 
painted a deep, rich yellow 
driving under an Italian sun. 

I have a British accent. 

I'm wearing dark shades 
an expensive silk shirt, 
there's no dirt under my 
fingernails. 

the radio plays Vivaldi 

and there are two women with 

me 

one with raven hair 
the other a blonde, 
they have small breasts and 
beautiful legs 

and they laugh at everything I 
say. 

as we drive up a steep road 

the blonde squeezes my leg 

and nestles closer 

while raven hair 

leans across and nibbles my 

ear. 

we stop for lunch at a quaint 
rustic inn. 

there is more laughter 
before lunch 
during lunch and after 
lunch. 

after lunch we will have a 
flat tire on the other side of 
the mountain 

and the blonde will change the 

tire 

while 

raven hair 
Photographs me 
ighting my pipe 
eaning against a tree 
the perfect background 
perfectly at peace 
with 
sunlight 
flowers 
clouds 
birds 

everywhere.

Mama 


here I am 

in the ground 

my mouth 
open 
and 

I can't even say 
mama, 
and 

the dogs run by and stop and piss 
on my stone; I get it all 
except the sun 
and my suit is looking 

bad 

and yesterday 

the last of my left 

arm gone 

very little left, all harp-like 
without music. 

at least a drunk 
in bed with a cigarette 
might cause 5 fire 

engines and 
33 men. 


I can't 

do 

any 

thing. 

but p.s. — Hector Richmond in the next 
tomb thinks only of Mozart and candy 
caterpillars, 
he is 

very bad 

company.

Marina 


majestic, majic 
infinite 

my little girl is 
sun 

on the carpet- 
out the door 
picking a flower, ha! 
an old man, 
battle-wrecked, 
emerges from his 
chair 

and she looks at me 
but only sees 
love, 

ha!, and I become 
quick with the world 
and love right back

Metamorphosis 

a girlfriend came in 
built me a bed 

scrubbed and waxed the kitchen floor 

scrubbed the walls 

vacuumed 

cleaned the toilet 

the bathtub 

scrubbed the bathroom floor 
and cut my toenails and 
my hair, 
then 

all on the same day 

the plumber came and fixed the kitchen faucet 
and the toilet 

and the gas man fixed the heater 
and the phone man fixed the phone, 
noe I sit in all this perfection, 
it is quiet. 

I have broken off with all 3 of my girlfriends. 

I felt better when everything was in 
disorder. 

it will take me some months to get back to normal: 
I can't even find a roach to commune with. 

I have lost my rythm. 

I can't sleep. 

I can't eat. 

I have been robbed of 
my filth.

my computer 


"what?" they say, "you got a 
<i>computer</i>?" 

it's like I have sold out to 
the enemy. 

I had no idea so many 
people were prejudiced 
against 
computers. 

even two editors have 
written me letters about 
the computer. 

one disparaged the 

computer in a mild and 

superior way. 

the other seemed 

genuinely 

pissed. 

I am aware that a 
computer can't create 
a poem. 

but neither can a 
typewriter. 

yet, still, once or 
twice a week 
I hear: 

"what? 
you have a

yes, I do 

and I sit up here 

almost every 

night, 

sometimes with 
beer or 
wine, 

sometimes 
without

I want to go 
the next step 
beyond the

I'm sure it's

they'll say,

"what?" 

"yes, it's true!" 

"I can't believe

and I'll also have 
some beer or 
some wine

my father 


was a truly amazing man 
he pretended to be 
rich 

even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies 
when we sat down to eat, he said, 

"not everybody can eat like this." 

and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually 

thought he was rich 

he always voted Republican 

and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt 

and he lost 

and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt 
and he lost again 

saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to, 
now we've got that god damned Red in there again 
and the Russians will be in our backyard next!" 

I think it was my father who made me decide to 
become a bum. 

I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich 
then I want to be poor. 

and I became a bum. 

I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and 
on park benches. 

I thought maybe the bums knew something. 

but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be 
rich too. 

they had just failed at that. 

so caught between my father and the bums 

I had no place to go 

and I went there fast and slow. 

never voted Republican 

never voted. 

buried him 

like an oddity of the earth 
like a hundred thousand oddities 
like millions of other oddities, 
wasted.

My First Affair With That Older Woman 

when I look back now 
at the abuse I took from 
her 

I feel shame that I was so 

innocent, 

but I must say 

she did match me drink for 

drink, 

and I realized that her life 
her feelings for things 
had been ruined 
along the way 

and that I was no mare than a 

temporary 

companion; 

she was ten years older 
and mortally hurt by the past 
and the present; 
she treated me badly: 
desertion, other 
men; 

she brought me immense 
pain, 

continually; 
she lied, stole; 
there was desertion, 


  


83 



other men, 

yet we had our moments; and 

our little soap opera ended 

with her in a coma 

in the hospital, 

and I sat at her bed 

for hours 

talking to her, 

and then she opened her eyes 
and saw me: 

 “I knew it would be you, “ 
she said. 

then hse closed her 
eyes. 

the next day she was 
dead. 

I drank alone 
for two years 
after that.

first time I met him, he said, 

"hey! ya gonna make a

"maybe," I answered. 

next meeting it was: 

"hey, Ramrod! what's 
happening?" 

"very little," I told 
him. 

next time I had my girlfriend with me 

and he just 

grinned. 

next time I was 
alone. 

"hey," he asked, "where's the young 
chick?" 

"I left her at home...." 

"<i>Bullshit</i>! I'll bet she dumped 
you!" 

and the next time 

he really leaned into the car: 

"what's a guy like < i >you </i > doing driving a 
BMW! I'll bet you inherited your 
money, you didn't get this car with your 
brains!" 

"how'd you guess?" I

My Groupie 


I read last Saturday in the 
redwoods outside of Santa Cruz 
and I was about 3/4's finished 
when I heard a long high scream 
and a quite attractive 
young girl came running toward me 
long gown &amp; divine eyes of fire 
and she leaped up on the stage 
and screamed:  “I WANT YOU! 
I WANT YOU! TAKE ME! TAKE 
ME! “ 

1 told her,  “look, get the hell 
away from me. “ 

but she kept tearing at my 
clothing and throwing herself 
at me. 

 “where were you, “ I 
asked her,  “when I was living 
on one candy bar a day and 
sending short stories to the 
Atlantic Monthly? “ 
she grabbed my balls and almost 
twisted them off. her kisses 
tasted like shitsoup. 

2 women jumped up on the stage 
and 

carried her off into the 
woods. 

I could still hear her screams 
as I began the next poem, 
mabye, I thought, I should have 
taken her on stage in front 
of all those eyes, 
but one can never be sure 
whether it's good poetry or 
bad acid.

New Mexico 


I was fairly drunk when it 

began and I took out my bottle and used it 

along the way. I was reading a week or two after 

Kandel and I did not look quite as 

pretty but 

I brought it off and we 

ended up at the Webbs, 6, 8, 10 of 

us, and I drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila 

and noticed a nice one sitting next to me - 

one tooth missing when she smiled, 

lovely, and I put my arm around her 

and began loading her with bullshit, when I awakened at 10 a.m. the next morning 
I was in a strange house 
in bed with this 

woman, she was asleep but looked 
familiar.

O, We Are The Outcasts 

ah, Christ, what a CREW: 
more 

poetry, always more 
POETRY. 

if it doesn't come, coax it out with a 
laxative, get your name in LIGHTS, 
get it up there in 
8 1/2 x 11 mimeo. 

keep it coming like a miracle. 

ah Christ, writers are the most sickening 
of all the louts! 

yellow-toothed, slump-shouldered, 
gutless, flea-bitten and 
obvious ... in tinker-toy rooms 
with their flabby hearts 
they tell us 

what's wrong with the world- 

as if we didn't know that a cop's club 

can crack the head 

and that war is a dirtier game than 

marriage ... 

or down in a basement bar 

hiding from a wife who doesn't appreciate him 

and children he doesn't 

want 

he tells us that his heart is drowning in 
vomit, hell, all our hearts are drowning in vomit, 
in pork salt, in bad verse, in soggy 
love. 

but he thinks he's alone and 

he thinks he's special and he thinks he's Rimbaud 

and he thinks he's 

Pound. 

and death! how about death? did you know 
that we all have to die? even Keats died, even 
Milton! 

and D. Thomas-THEY KILLED HIM, of course. 

Thomas didn't want all those free drinks 

all that free pussy- 

they . . . FORCED IT ON HIM 

when they should have left him alone so he could 

write write WRITE! 

poets. 

and there's another 

type. I've met them at their country 

places (don't ask me what I was doing there because 


  


92 



I don't know). 


they were born with money and 
they don't have to dirty their hands in 
slaughterhouses or washing 
dishes in grease joints or 
driving cabs or pimping or selling pot. 

this gives them time to understand 
Life. 

they walk in with their cocktail glass 
held about heart high 
and when they drink they just 
sip. 

you are drinking green beer which you 
brought with you 

because you have found out through the years 

that rich bastards are tight- 

they use 5 cent stamps instead of airmail 

they promise to have all sorts of goodies ready 

upon your arrival 

from gallons of whisky to 

50 cent cigars, but it's never 

there. 

and they HIDE their women from you- 

their wives, x-wives, daughters, maids, so forth, 

because they've read your poems and 

figure all you want to do is fuck everybody and 

everything, which once might have been 

true but is no longer quite 

true. 

and- 

he WRITES TOO. 

POETRY, of 
course, everybody 
writes 
poetry. 

he has plenty of time and a 

postoffice box in town 

and he drives there 3 or 4 times a day 

looking and hoping for accepted 

poems. 

he thinks that poverty is a weakness of the 
soul. 

he thinks your mind is ill because you are 
drunk all the time and have to work in a 


  


93 



factory 10 or 12 hours a 
night. 

he brings his wife in, a beauty, stolen from a 

poorer rich 

man. 

he lets you gaze for 30 seconds 
then hustles her 

out. she has been crying for some 
reason. 

you've got 3 or 4 days to linger in the 
guesthouse he says, 

 “come on over to dinner 

sometime.  “ 

but he doesn't say when or 

where, and then you find out that you are not even 
IN HIS HOUSE. 

you are in 

ONE of his houses but 
his house is somewhere 
else- 

you don't know 
where. 

he even has x-wives in some of his 
houses. 

his main concern is to keep his x-wives away from 
you. he doesn't want to give up a 
damn thing, and you can't blame him: 
his x-wives are all young, stolen, kept, 
talented, well-dressed, schooled, with 
varying French-German accents. 

and!: they 

WRITE POETRY TOO. or 

PAINT, or 

fuck. 

but his big problem is to get down to that mail 
box in town to get back his 
rejected poems 

and to keep his eye on all the other mail boxes 

in all his other 

houses. 

meanwhile, the starving Indians 

sell beads and baskets in the streets of the small desert 
town. 


  


94 



the Indians are not allowed in his houses 
not so much because they are a fuck-threat 
but because they are 
dirty and 

ignorant, dirty? I look down at my shirt 
with the beerstain on the front, 
ignorant? I light a 6 cent cigar and 
forget about 
it. 

he or they or somebody was supposed to meet me at 
the 

train station, 
of course, they weren't 

there.  “We'll be there to meet the great 
Poetl “ 

well, I looked around and didn't see any 

great poet, besides it was 7 a.m. and 

40 degrees, those things 

happen, the trouble was there were no 

bars open, nothing open, not even a 

jail. 

he's a poet. 

he's also a doctor, a head-shrinker. 
no blood involved that 

way. he won't tell me whether I am crazy or 

not-I don't have the 

money. 

he walks out with his cocktail glass 
disappears for 2 hours, 3 hours, 
then suddenly comes walking back in 
unannounced 

with the same cocktail glass 
to make sure I haven't gotten hold of 
something more precious than 
Life itself. 

my cheap green beer is killing 
me. he shows heart (hurrah) and 
gives me a little pill that stops my 
gagging. 

but nothing decent to 
drink. 

he'd bought a small 6 pack 

for my arrival but that was gone in an 

hour and 15 

minutes. 


  


95 



 “ril buy you barrels of beer, “ he had 
said. 

I used his phone (one of his phones) 

to get deliveries of beer and 

cheap whisky, the town was ten miles away, 

downhill. I peeled my poor dollars from my poor 

roll, and the boy needed a tip, of 

course. 

the way it was shaping up I could see that I was 

hardly Dylan Thomas yet, not even 

Robert Creeley. certainly Creeley wouldn't have 

had beerstains on his 

shirt. 

anyhow, when I finally got hold of one of his 
x-wives I was too drunk to 
make it. 

scared too. sure, I imagined him peering 
through the window- 
he didn't want to give up a damn thing- 
and 

leveling the luger while I was 
working 

while  “The March to the Gallows “ was playing over 
the Muzak 

and shooting me in the ass first and 

my poor brain 

later. 

 “an intruder,  “ I could hear him telling them, 
 “ravishing one of my helpless x-wives.  “ 

I see him published in some of the magazines 
now. not very good stuff. 

a poem about me 
too: the Polack. 

the Polack whines too much, the Polack whines about his 
country, other countries, all countries, the Polack 
works overtime in a factory like a fool, among other 
fools with  “pre-drained spirits.  “ 
the Polack drinks seas of green beer 
full of acid, the Polack has an ulcerated 
hemorrhoid, the Polack picks on fags 
 “fragile fags. “ the Polack hates his 
wife, hates his daughter, his daughter will become 
an alcoholic, a prostitute, the Polack has an 


  


96 



 “obese burned out wife. “ the Polack has a 
spastic gut. the Polack has a 
 “rectal brain.  “ 

thank you, Doctor (and poet), any charge for 

this? I know I still owe you for the 

pill. 

Your poem is not too good 
but at least I got your starch up. 
most of your stuff is about as lively as a 
wet and deflated 

beachball. but it is your round, you've won a round. 

going to invite me out this

On Going Back To The Street After Viewing An Art Show 


they talk down through 

the centuries to us, 

and this we need more and more, 

the statues and paintings 

in midnight age 

as we go along 

holding dead hands. 

and we would say 

rather than delude the knowing: 

a damn good show, 

but hardly enough for a horse to eat, 

and out on the sunshine street where 

eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces 

i decide again 

that in theses centuries 

they have done very well 

considering the nature of their 

brothers: 

it's more than good 
that some of them, 

(closer really to the field-mouse than 
falcon) 

have been bold enough to try.

one thirty-six a.m. 


I laugh sometimes when I think about 
say 

Celine at a typewriter 
or Dostoevsky... 
or Hamsun... 

ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes, 
ordinary men with hair on their heads 
sitting there typing words 
while having difficulties with life 
while being puzzled almost to madness. 

Dostoevsky gets up 
he leaves the machine to piss, 
comes back 

drinks a glass of milk and thinks about 
the casino and 
the roulette wheel. 

Celine stops, gets up, walks to the 

window, looks out, thinks, my last patient 

died today, I won't have to make any more 

visits there. 

when I saw him last 

he paid his doctor bill; 

it's those who don't pay their bills, 

they live on and on. 

Celine walks back, sits down at the 
machine 

is still for a good two minutes 
then begins to type. 

Hamsun stands over his machine thinking, 

I wonder if they are going to believe 
all these things I write? 
he sits down, begins to type, 
he doesn't know what a writer's block 
is: 

he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch 
damn near as magnificent as 
the sun. 
he types away. 

and I laugh 
not out loud 

but all up and down these walls, these 
dirty yellow and blue walls 
my white cat asleep on the 
table 

hiding his eyes from the 
light. 

he's not alone tonight

Pull A String, A Puppet Moves 

each man must realize 
that it can all disappear very 
quickly: 

the cat, the woman, the job, 
the front tire, 
the bed, the walls, the 
room; all our necessities 
including love, 

rest on foundations of sand - 
and any given cause, 
no matter how unrelated: 
the death of a boy in Hong Kong 
or a blizzard in Omaha ... 
can serve as your undoing, 
all your chinaware crashing to the 
kitchen floor, your girl will enter 
and you'll be standing, drunk, 
in the center of it and she'll ask: 
my god, what's the matter? 
and you'll answer: I don't know, 

I don't know ...

Raw With Love 


little dark girl with 
kind eyes 

when it comes time to 
use the knife 
I won't flinch and 
I won't blame 
you, 

as I drive along the shore alone 
as the palms wave, 
the ugly heavy palms, 
as the living does not arrive 
as the dead do not leave, 

I won't blame you, 
instead 

I will remember the kisses 
our lips raw with love 
and how you gave me 
everything you had 
and how I 

offered you what was left of 
me, 

and I will remember your small room 

the feel of you 

the light in the window 

your records 

your books 

our morning coffee 

our noons our nights 

our bodies spilled together 

sleeping 

the tiny flowing currents 
immediate and forever 
your leg my leg 
your arm my arm 
your smile and the warmth 
of you 

who made me laugh 
again. 

little dark girl with kind eyes 
you have no 
knife, the knife is 
mine and I won't use it 
yet.

Revolt In The Ranks 


I have just spent one-hour-and-a-half 

handicapping tomorrow's 

card. 

when am I going to get at the poems? 
well, they'll just have to wait 
they'll have to warm their feet in the 
anteroom 

where they'll sit gossiping about 
me. 

 “this Chinaski, doesn't he realize that 
without us he would have long ago 
gone mad, been dead? “ 

 “he knows, but he thinks he can keep 
us at his beck and calll “ 

 “he's an ingratel “ 

 “let's give him writer's blockl “ 
 “yeah! “ 

 “yeah! “ 

 “yeah! “ 

the little poems kick up their heels 

and laugh.

walks toward the door. 

 “hey, where are you going? “ he is

 “somewhere where I am

vanish.

Shoes 


when you're young 
a pair of 
female 

high-heeled shoes 
just sitting 
alone 

in the closet 
can fire your 
bones; 

when you're old 
it's just 

a pair of shoes 

without 

anybody 

in them 

and 

just as 

well.

Show Biz 


I can't have it 
and you can't have it 
and we won't 
get it 

so don't bet on it 
or even think about 
it 

just get out of bed 
each morning 

wash 

shave 

clothe 

yourself 

and go out into 

it 

because 
outside of that 
all that's left is 
suicide and 
madness 

so you just 
can't 

expect too much 

you can't even 
expect 

so what you do 
is 

work from a modest 

minimal 

base 

like when you 
walk outside 
be glad your car 
might possibly 
be there 

and if it is- 
that the tires 
aren't 
flat 

then you get 
in 

and if it 


  


116 



starts--you 

start. 


and 

it's the damndest 
movie 

you've ever 
seen 
because 
you're 
in it— 

low budget 
and 

4 billion 
critics 

and the longest 
run 

you ever hope 

for 

is 

one 

day.

"but when he left Hollywood, I stayed on, and while I 
didn't drink like that maybe I should have, I might have 
had the guts then to follow him and get the hell out of

Something For The Touts, The Nuns, The Grocery Clerks, And You . . . 

we have everything and we have nothing 
and some men do it in churches 
and some men do it by tearing butterflies 
in half 

and some men do it in Palm Springs 

laying it into butterblondes 

with Cadillac souls 

Cadillacs and butterflies 

nothing and everything, 

the face melting down to the last puff 

in a cellar in Corpus Christi. 

there's something for the touts, the nuns, 

the grocery clerks and you . . . 

something at 8 a.m., something in the library 

something in the river, 

everything and nothing. 

in the slaughterhouse it comes running along 

the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it -- 

one 

two 

three 

and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead 
meat, its bones against your bones 
something and nothing, 
it's always early enough to die and 
it's always too late, 

and the drill of blood in the basin white 

it tells you nothing at all 

and the gravediggers playing poker over 

5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass 

to dismiss the frost ... 

they tell you nothing at all. 

we have everything and we have nothing — 
days with glass edges and the impossible stink 
of river moss — worse than shit; 
checkerboard days of moves and countermoves, 
fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as 
in victory; slow days like mules 
humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed 
up a road where a madman sits waiting among 
bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey 
grey. 

good days too of wine and shouting, fights 

in alleys, fat legs of women striving around 

your bowels buried in moans, 

the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering 

Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground 

telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves 

that robbed you. 

days when children say funny and brilliant things 
like savages trying to send you a message through 


  


123 



their bodies while their bodies are still 
alive enough to transmit and feel and run up 
and down without locks and paychecks and 
ideals and possessions and beetle-like 
opinions. 

days when you can cry all day long in 
a green room with the door locked, days 
when you can laugh at the breadman 
because his legs are too long, days 
of looking at hedges . . . 

and nothing, and nothing, the days of 
the bosses, yellow men 
with bad breath and big feet, men 
who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk 
as if melody had never been invented, men 
who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and 
profit, men with expensive wives they possess 
like 60 acres of ground to be drilled 
or shown-off or to be walled away from 
the incompetent, men who'd kill you 
because they're crazy and justify it because 
it's the law, men who stand in front of 
windows 30 feet wide and see nothing, 
men with luxury yachts who can sail around 
the world and yet never get out of their vest 
Dockets, men like snails, men like eels, men 
ike slugs, and not as good . . . 
and nothing, getting your last paycheck 
at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an 
aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a 
barbershop, at a job you didn't want 
anyway. 

income tax, sickness, servility, broken 
arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing 
come out like an old pillow. 

we have everything and we have nothing, 
some do it well enough for a while and 
then give way. fame gets them or disgust 
or age or lack of proper diet or ink 
across the eyes or children in college 
or new cars or broken backs while skiing 
in Switzerland or new politics or new wives 
or just natural change and decay -- 
the man you knew yesterday hooking 
for ten rounds or drinking for three days and 
three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now 
just something under a sheet or a cross 
or a stone or under an easy delusion, 
or packing a bible or a golf bag or a 
briefcase: how they go, how they go! — all 


  


124 



the ones you thought would never go. 

days like this, like your day today, 
maybe the rain on the window trying to 
get through to you. what do you see today? 
what is it? where are you? the best 
days are sometimes the first, sometimes 
the middle and even sometimes the last, 
the vacant lots are not bad, churches in 
Europe on postcards are not bad. people in 
wax museums frozen into their best sterility 
are not bad, horrible but not bad. the 
cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for 
breakfast the coffee hot enough you 
know your tongue is still there, three 
geraniums outside a window, trying to be 
red and trying to be pink and trying to be 
geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women 
cry, no wonder the mules don't want 
to go up the hill, are you in a hotel room 
in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more 
good day. a little bit of it. and as 
the nurses come out of the building after 
their shift, having had enough, eight nurses 
with different names and different places 
to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them 
want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a 
hot bath, some of them want a man, some 
of them are hardly thinking at all. enough 
and not enough, arcs and pilgrims, oranges 
gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of 
tissue paper. 

in the most decent sometimes sun 
there is the softsmoke feeling from urns 
and the canned sound of old battleplanes 
and if you go inside and run your finger 
along the window ledge you'll find 
dirt, maybe even earth, 
and if you look out the window 
there will be the day, and as you 
get older you'll keep looking 
keep looking 

sucking your tongue in a little 
ah ah no no maybe 

some do it naturally 
some obscenely 
everywhere.

Sway With Me 


sway with me, everything sad -- 
madmen in stone houses 
without doors, 

lepers steaming love and song 
frogs trying to figure 
the sky; 

sway with me, sad things -- 
fingers split on a forge 
old age like breakfast shell 
used books, used people 
used flowers, used love 
I need you 
I need you 
I need you: 
it has run away 
like a horse or a dog, 
dead or lost

The Aliens 


you may not believe it 
but there are people 
who go through life with 
very little 
friction or 
distress. 

they dress well, eat 
well, sleep well, 
they are contented with 
their family 
life. 

they have moments of 
grief 

but all in all 

they are undisturbed 

and often feel 

very good. 

and when they die 

it is an easy 

death, usually in their 

sleep.

The Blackbirds are Rough Today 

lonely as a dry and used orchard 
spread over the earth 
for use and surrender. 

shot down like an ex-pug selling 
dailies on the corner. 

taken by tears like 

an aging chorus girl 

who has gotten her last check. 

a hanky is in order your lord your 
worship. 

the blackbirds are rough today 
like 

ingrown toenails 
in an overnight 
jail — 

wine wine whine, 
the blackbirds run around and 
fly around 
harping about 

Spanish melodies and bones. 

and everywhere is 
nowhere--- 

the dream is as bad as 
flapjacks and flat tires: 

why do we go on 
with our minds and 
pockets full of 
dust 

like a bad boy just out of 

school--- 

you tell 

me, 

you who were a hero in some 
revolution 

you who teach children 

you who drink with calmness 

you who own large homes 

and walk in gardens 

you who have killed a man and own a 

beautiful wife 

you tell me 

why I am on fire like old dry 
garbage. 

we might surely have some interesting 
correspondence.

and the butterflies and ants and bridges and

the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics

flowers of chance,

The Genius Of The Crowd 


there is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the average 
human being to supply any given army on any given day 

and the best at murder are those who preach against it 

and the best at hate are those who preach love 

and the best at war finally are those who preach peace 

those who preach god, need god 

those who preach peace do not have peace 

those who preach peace do not have love 

beware the preachers 
beware the knowers 

beware those who are always reading books 
beware those who either detest poverty 
or are proud of it 
beware those quick to praise 
for they need praise in return 
beware those who are quick to censor 
they are afraid of what they do not know 
beware those who seek constant crowds for 
they are nothing alone 

beware the average man the average woman 
beware their love, their love is average 
seeks average 

but there is genius in their hatred 

there is enough genius in their hatred to kill you 

to kill anybody 

not wanting solitude 

not understanding solitude 

they will attempt to destroy anything 

that differs from their own 

not being able to create art 

they will not understand art 

they will consider their failure as creators 

only as a failure of the world 

not being able to love fully 

they will believe your love incomplete 

and then they will hate you 

and their hatred will be perfect 

like a shining diamond 
like a knife 
like a mountain 
like a tiger 
like hemlock

the German hotel 


the German hotel was very strange and expensive and had 
double doors to the rooms, very thick doors, and it over- 
looked the park and the vasser tern and in the mornings 
it was usually too late for breakfast and the maids 
would be everywhere changing sheets and bringing in 
towels, but you never saw any hotel guests, only the 
maids and the desk man and the day desk man was all 
right because we were sober during the day but we had 
trouble with the night man who was some sort of snob 
and not very good with getting the corkscrews and ice 
and wine glasses up to us and he was always phoning to 
say the other guests objected to our noise, 
what other guests? 

I always told him that everything was very quiet, 

nothing was going on, that somebody must be crazy, so 

will you please stop ringing? 

but he kept ringing, he became almost like a 

companion to us through the night. 

but the day man was very nice, he always had little 

messages of importance that either meant money, or a 

good friend coming to see us, or both. 

we stayed at the hotel twice during our trip to 

Europe and each time we checked out the day clerk 

bowed ever so slightly, he was tall and well-dressed 

and pleasant and he said each time: "it was nice to 

have you with us. please come here again if you return." 

"thank you," we said, "thank you." 

it's our favorite hotel and if I ever get rich I am 
going to buy it and fire the night clerk and there will 
be enough ice cubes and corkscrews for everybody.

the great slob 


I was always a natural slob 
I liked to lay upon the bed 
in undershirt (stained, of 
course) (and with cigarette 
holes) 
shoes off 
beerbottle in hand 
trying to shake off a 
difficult night, say with a 
woman still around 
walking the floor 
complaining about this and 
that, 

and I'd work up a 
belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T 
LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS 
OUT OF HERE!” 

I really loved myself, I 
really loved my slob- 
self, and 

they seemed to also: 

always leaving 

but almost 

always 

coming 

back.

The History Of One Tough Motherfucker 

he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and 
terrorized 

a white cross-eyed tailless cat 

I took him in and fed him and he stayed 

grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway 

and ran him over 

I took what was left to a vet who said,  “ not much 
chance. ..give him these pills. ..his backbone 
is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow 
mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at 
these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets 
are still there. ..also, he once had a tail, somebody 
cut it off... “

The House 


They are building a house 

half a block down 

and I sit up here 

with the shades down 

listening to the sounds, 

the hammers pounding in nails, 

thack thack thack thack, 

and then I hear birds, 

and thack thack thack, 

and I go to bed, 

I pull the covers to my throat; 
they have been building this house 
for a month, and soon it will have 
its people. ..sleeping, eating, 
loving, moving around, 
but somehow 
now 

it is not right, 
there seems a madness, 
men walk on top with nails 
in their mouths 

and I read about Castro and Cuba, 

and at night I walk by 

and the ribs of the house show 

and inside I can see cats walking 

the way cats walk, 

and then a boy rides by on a bicycle 

and still the house is not done 

and in the morning the men 

will be back 

walking around on the house 
with their hammers, 

and it seems people should not build houses 
anymore, 

it seems people should not get married 
anymore, 

it seems people should stop working 
and sit in small rooms 
on 2nd floors 

under electric lights without shades; 

it seems there is a lot to forget 

and a lot not to do, 

and in drugstores, markets, bars, 

the people are tired, they do not want 

to move, and I stand there at night 

and look through this house and the 

house does not want to be built; 

through its sides I can see the purple hills 

and the first lights of evening, 

and it is cold 

and I button my coat 

and I stand there looking through the house 


  


141 



and the cats stop and look at me 

until I am embarrased 

and move North up the sidewalk 

where I will buy 

cigarettes and beer 

and return to my room.

The Icecream People 


the lady has me temporarily off the bottle 

and now the pecker stands up 

better. 

however, things change overnight— 
instead of listening to Shostakovich and 
Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke 
the nights change, new 
complexities: 

we drive to Baskin-Robbins, 

31 flavors: 

Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry 
Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint... 

we park outside and look at icecream 
people 

a very healthy and satisfied people, 
nary a potential suicide in sight 
(they probably even vote) 
and I tell her 

"what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they 
find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?" 
"come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in 
and stand with the icecream people, 
none of them are cursing or threatening 
the clerks. 

there seem to be no hangovers or 
grievances. 

I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave 
that flows about. I feel like a leper in a 
beauty contest, we finally get our sundaes and 
sit in the car and eat them. 

I must admit they are quite good, a curious new 
world, (all my friends tell me I am looking 
better, "you're looking good, man, we thought you 
were going to die there for a while...") 

—those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the 
hospitals... 

and later that night 

there is use for the pecker, use for 

love, and it is glorious, 

long and true, 

and afterwards we speak of easy things; 
our heads by the open window with the moonlight 
looking through, we sleep in each other's 
arms. 

the icecream people make me feel good, 
inside and out.

the lucky ones 


stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6:15 p.m., 
these are the lucky ones, these are the 
dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud 
as possible as they try not to think or remember. 

this is our new civilization: as men 
once lived in trees and caves now they live 
in their automobiles and on freeways as 

the local news is heard again and again while 
we shift from first gear to second and back to first. 

there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood 
up, he's standing against the freeway fence 
a newspaper over his head in the rain. 

the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into 
the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off. 

in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a 
police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely 
can't be <i>speeding</i> as 

suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the 
cars stop and 

even with the windows up I can smell somebody's clutch 
burning. 

I just hope it's not mine as 

the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first 
gear; we are all still 
a long way from home as I memorize 

the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the 

driver's head or 
what 

I can see of it above the headrest while 

his bumper sticker asks me 

HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR KID TODAY? 

suddenly I have an urge to scream 

as another wall of water comes down and the 

man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent 

chance of showers tomorrow night

The Sun Weilds Mercy 


and the sun weilds mercy 
but like a jet torch carried to high, 
and the jets whip across its sight 
and rockets leap like toads, 
and the boys get out the maps 
and pin-cuishon the moon, 
old green cheese, 

no life there but too much on earth: 

our unwashed India boys 

crosssing their legs, playing pipes, 

starving with sucked in bellies, 

watching the snakes volute 

like beautiful women in the hungry air; 

the rockets leap, 

the rockets leap like hares, 

clearing clump and dog 

replacing out-dated bullets; 

the Chineses still carve 

in jade, quietly stuffing rice 

into their hunger, a hunger 

a thousand years old, 

their muddy rivers moving with fire 

and song, barges, houseboats 

pushed by drifting poles 

of waiting without wanting; 

in Turkey they face the East 

on their carpets 

praying to a purple god 

who smokes and laughs 

and sticks fingers in their eyes 

blinding them, as gods will do; 

but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer, 

for some reason, precious; 

madness drifts like lily pads 

on a pond circling senselessly; 

the painters paint dipping 

their reds and greens and yellows, 

poets rhyme their lonliness, 

musicians starve as always 

and the novelists miss the mark, 

but not the pelican , the gull; 

pelicans dip and dive, rise, 

shaking shocked half-dead 

radioactive fish from their beaks; 

indeed, indeed, the waters wash 

the rocks with slime; and on wall st.

The Sun Wields Mercy 


and the sun wields mercy 
but like a jet torch carried to high, 
and the jets whip across its sight 
and rockets leap like toads, 
and the boys get out the maps 
and pin-cushion the moon, 
old green cheese, 

no life there but too much on earth: 

our unwashed India boys 

crossing their legs, playing pipes, 

starving with sucked in bellies, 

watching the snakes volute 

like beautiful women in the hungry air; 

the rockets leap, 

the rockets leap like hares, 

clearing clump and dog 

replacing out-dated bullets; 

the Chinese still carve 

in jade, quietly stuffing rice 

into their hunger, a hunger 

a thousand years old, 

their muddy rivers moving with fire 

and song, barges, houseboats 

pushed by drifting poles 

of waiting without wanting; 

in Turkey they face the East 

on their carpets 

praying to a purple god 

who smokes and laughs 

and sticks fingers in their eyes 

blinding them, as gods will do; 

but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer, 

for some reason, precious; 

madness drifts like lily pads 

on a pond circling senselessly; 

the painters paint dipping 

their reds and greens and yellows, 

poets rhyme their loneliness, 

musicians starve as always 

and the novelists miss the mark, 

but not the pelican , the gull; 

pelicans dip and dive, rise, 

shaking shocked half-dead 

radioactive fish from their beaks; 

indeed, indeed, the waters wash 

the rocks with slime; and on wall st.

looking for his key; ah, 

this will be a good one, by God: 

it will take us back to the 

sabre-teeth, the winged monkey

These Things 


these things that we support most well 

have nothing to do with up, 

and we do with them 

out of boredom or fear or money 

or cracked intelligence; 

our circle and our candle of light 

being small, 

so small we cannot bear it, 

we heave out with Idea 

and lose the Center: 

all wax without the wick, 

and we see names that once meant 

wisdom, 

like signs into ghost towns, 
and only the graves are real.

Three Oranges 


first time my father overheard me listening to 
this bit of music he asked me, 

 “what is it? “ 

 “it's called Love For Three Oranges,  “ 

I informed him. 

 “boy, “ he said,  “that's getting it 
cheap.  “ 
he meant sex. 
listening to it 

I always imagined three oranges 
sitting there, 

you know how orange they can 
get, 

so mightily orange, 
maybe Prokofiev had meant 
what my father 
thought. 

if so, I preferred it the 
other way 

the most horrible thing 
I could think of 
was part of me being 
what ejaculated out of the 
end of his 
stupid penis. 

I will never forgive him 
for that, 

his trick that I am stuck 
with, 

I find no nobility in 
parenthood. 

I say kill the Father 
before he makes more 
such as 
I.

To The Whore Who Took My Poems 

some say we should keep personal remorse from the 
poem, 

stay abstract, and there is some reason in this, 
but jezus; 

twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have 
my 

paintings too, my best ones; its stifling: 

are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them? 

why didn't you take my money? they usually do 

from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner. 

next time take my left arm or a fifty 

but not my poems: 

I'm not Shakespeare 
but sometime simply 

there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise; 
there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards 
down to the last bomb, 
but as God said, 
crossing his legs, 

I see where I have made plenty of poets 

but not so very much 

poetry.

True Story 

they found him walking along the freeway 

all red in 

front 

he had taken a rusty tin can 

and cut off his sexual 

machinery 

as if to say — 

see what you've done to 

me? you might as well have the 

rest. 

and he put part of him 
in one pocket and 
part of him in 
another 

and that's how they found him, 

walking 

along. 

they gave him over to the 
doctors 

who tried to sew the parts 

back 

on 

but the parts were 
quite contented 
the way they 
were. 

I think sometimes of all of the good 
ass 

turned over to the 
monsters of the 
world. 

maybe it was his protest against 

this or 

his protest 

against 

everything. 

a one man 
Freedom March 
that never squeezed in 
between 

the concert reviews and the 

baseball 

scores. 

God, or somebody, 

bless 

him.

What A Writer 


what i liked about e.e. cummings 
was that he cut away from 
the holiness of the 
word 

and with charm 

and gamble 

gave us lines 

that sliced through the 

dung. 

how it was needed! 

how we were withering 

away 

in the old 

tired 

manner. 

of course, then came all 
the e.e. cummings 
copyists. 

they copied him then 
as the others had 
copied Keats, Shelly, 

Swinburne, Byron, et 
al. 

but there was only 
one 

e.e. cummings. 
of course. 

one sun. 

one moon.

What Can We Do? 


at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity, 
some understanding and, at times, acts of 
courage 

but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't 
have too much. 

it is like a large animal deep in sleep and 
almost nothing can awaken it. 
when activated it's best at brutality, 
selfishness, unjust judgments, murder.

Whats The Use Of A Title? 


They don't make it 
the beautiful die in flame- 
suicide pills, rat poison, rope what- 
ever... 

they rip their arms off, 

throw themselves out of windows, 

they pull their eyes out of the sockets, 

reject love 

reject hate 

reject, reject. 

they don't make it 
the beautiful can't endure, 
they are butterflies 
they are doves 
they are sparrows, 
they don't make it. 

one tall shot of flame 

while the old men play checkers in the park 
one flame, one good flame 
while the old men play checkers in the park 
in the sun. 

the beautiful are found in the edge of a room 
crumpled into spiders and needles and silence 
and we can never understand why they 
left, they were so 
beautiful. 

they don't make it, 

the beautiful die young 

and leave the ugly to their ugly lives. 

lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death 
as the old men play checkers in the sun 
in the park.

Yes Yes 


when God created love he didn't help most 
when God created dogs He didn't help dogs 
when God created plants that was average 
when God created hate we had a standard utility 
when God created me He created me 
when God created the monkey He was asleep 
when He created the giraffe He was drunk 
when He created narcotics He was high 
and when He created suicide He was low 

when He created you lying in bed 
He knew what He was doing 
He was drunk and He was high 

and He created the mountians and the sea and fire at the same time 

He made some mistakes 

but when He created you lying in bed 

He came all over His Blessed Universe.

Young in New Orleans 


starving there, sitting around the bars, 
and at night walking the streets for 
hours, 

the moonlight always seemed fake 
to me, maybe it was, 
and in the French Quarter I watched 
the horses and buggies going by, 
everybody sitting high in the open 
carriages, the black driver, and in 
back the man and the woman, 
usually young and always white, 
and I was always white, 
and hardly charmed by the 
world. 

New Orleans was a place to 
hide. 

I could piss away my life, 

unmolested. 

except for the rats. 

the rats in my dark small room 

very much resented sharing it 

with me. 

they were large and fearless 
and stared at me with eyes 
that spoke 
an unblinking 
death. 

women were beyond me. 
they saw something 
depraved. 

there was one waitress 
a little older than 
I, she rather smiled, 
lingered when she 
brought my 
coffee. 

that was plenty for 
me, that was 
enough. 

there was something about 

that city, though 

it didn't let me feel guilty 

that I had no feeling for the 

things so many others 

needed. 

it let me alone. 

sitting up in my bed 
the Mights out, 


  


175 



hearing the outside 
sounds, 

lifting my cheap 
bottle of wine, 
letting the warmth of 
the grape 
enter 
me 

as I heard the rats 
moving about the 
room, 

I preferred them 
to 

humans. 

being lost, 
being crazy maybe 
is not so bad 
if you can be 
that way 
undisturbed. 

New Orleans gave me 
that. 

nobody ever called 
my name. 

no telephone, 
no car, 
no job, 
no 

anything. 

me and the 
rats 

and my youth, 
one time, 
that time 
I knew 

even through the 

nothingness, 

it was a 

celebration 

of something not to 

do 

but only 
know.
